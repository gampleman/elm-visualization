{-| This module implements a velocity Verlet numerical integrator for simulating physical forces on particles.
The simulation is simplified: it assumes a constant unit time step _Δt = 1_ for each step, and a constant unit
mass _m = 1_ for all particles. As a result, a force _F_ acting on a particle is equivalent to a constant
acceleration _a_ over the time interval _Δt_, and can be simulated simply by adding to the particle’s velocity,
which is then added to the particle’s position.

{-| Force needs to compute and update positions and velocities on any objects that it is simulating.
However, you can use your own data structure to manage these, as long as the individual objects expose the necessary
properties. Therefore this type alias is an extensible record allowing you to avoid excessive nesting.

The `id` property must be unique among objects, otherwise some of the colliding objects will be ignored by the simulation.

Also take care when initializing the positions so that the points don't overlap.

{-| The centering force translates nodes uniformly so that the mean position of all nodes (the center of mass) is at
the given position ⟨x,y⟩. This force modifies the positions of nodes on each application; it does not modify velocities,
as doing so would typically cause the nodes to overshoot and oscillate around the desired center. This force helps keep
nodes in the center of the viewport, and it does not distort their relative positions.
-}

{-| The many-body (or n-body) force applies mutually amongst all nodes. It can be used to simulate gravity (attraction)
if the strength is positive, or electrostatic charge (repulsion) if the strength is negative.

Unlike links, which only affect two linked nodes, the charge force is global: it affects all nodes whose ids are passed
to it.

The default strength is -30 simulating a repulsing charge.

-}

{-| This allows you to specify the strength of the many-body force.
-}
manyBodyStrength : Float -> List comparable -> Force comparable
manyBodyStrength strength =
    customManyBody 0.9 << List.map (\key -> ( key, strength ))


{-| This is the most flexible, but complex way to specify many body forces.

The first argument, let's call it _theta_, controls how much approximation to apply. The default value is 0.9.

To accelerate computation, this force implements the [Barnes–Hut approximation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation) which takes O(n log n) per application where n is the number of nodes. For each application, a quadtree stores the current node positions; then for each node, the combined force of all other nodes on the given node is computed. For a cluster of nodes that is far away, the charge force can be approximated by treating the cluster as a single, larger node. The theta parameter determines the accuracy of the approximation: if the ratio w / l of the width w of the quadtree cell to the distance l from the node to the cell’s center of mass is less than theta, all nodes in the given cell are treated as a single node rather than individually. Setting this to 0 will disable the optimization.

This function also allows you to set the force strength individually on each node.

{-| The link force pushes linked nodes together or apart according to the desired link distance. The strength of the
force is proportional to the difference between the linked nodes’ distance and the target distance, similar to a spring
force.

The link distance here is 30, the strength of the force is proportional to the number of links on each side of the
present link, according to the formule: `1 / min (count souce) (count target)` where `count` if a function that counts
links connected to those nodes.

-}

{-| Allows you to specify the link distance and optionally the strength. You must also specify the iterations count (the default in `links` is 1). Increasing the number of iterations greatly increases the rigidity of the constraint and is useful for complex structures such as lattices, but also increases the runtime cost to evaluate the force.
