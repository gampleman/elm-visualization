{-| A multiway tree or rosetree is a labeled tree where each node can have zero,
one or more children, each of which represents a tree in its own right.

The root of the tree is always labeled, so a tree always has at least one label.

As an example, such a structure could represent a directory structure:

    tree "root"
        [ tree "home"
            [ tree "user1" []
            , tree "user2" []
            ]
        , tree "etc" []
        , tree "var"
            [ tree "log" []
            ]
        ]

In a sense, `Html msg` is pretty similar to how such trees look, but they can be
used to represent other things. A nested menu structure, or a sitemap, or any
other structure where a single root is connected to children which can each have
children of their own, and so on.

# Advanced: Generic traversals

These functions have highly complex type signatures, but they abstract very
generic ways of working with trees and in fact nearly all the other functions
in this library are built using them. In general it is better to prefer the simpler
interfaces, but there are situations that may not be covered by other functions
in this library, where these more powerful functions can come in handy.

Note that all the callbacks passed receive four arguments:

  - the `state` variable that is accumulated throughout the whole computation
  - a list of `ancestors`, that is all the labels that lie above the current node
  - the current `label` of the node being processed
  - its `children`

I like to call these `\s a l c`, since "salc" is nice and pronouncable and quite
easy to remember.

You may want to read the source of this module for inspiration on how to use these
functions.

{-| Represents a multiway tree. Each node in the tree holds a piece of
information (the `label`) and a list of children, each of which is a tree.

**Note:** The constructors here are exposed as this can be sometimes easier
to program than having to use the functions provided and can be an easy way
to unblock yourself to build tree processing algorithms.

However the naive way of building tree algorithms is _not_ stack safe and
can cause crashes for large tree inputs.

For instance, a `map` function can trivially be defined as:

    map : (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
    map fn (Tree l c) =
        Tree (fn l) (List.map (map fn) c)

However, running this definition on a large tree can easily throw a
`Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`.

Instead, it is often better to look at this libraries generic traversal
functions, which can provide a stack safe implementation without too
much overhead:

    map : (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
    map fn t =
        Tree.depthFirstTraversal
            -- pass through state, apply fn to label, pass through children
            (\s a l c -> ( s, fn l, c ))
            -- pass through state, reassemble tree
            (\s a l c -> ( s, Tree.tree l c ))
            -- we don't really care about state
            ()
            t
            -- discard state
            |> Tuple.second

With this in mind, it's certainly OK to unblock yourself with the simpler version!

has the number of children mentioned in the label, recursively.

{-| `stratify` tries to convert the entire

two nodes that had such property.

    [ ( "root1", Nothing )
    , ( "root2", Nothing)
    ]
    |> stratify { id = Tuple.first, parentId = Tuple.second, transform = Tuple.first }

**`NoRoot`** is returned when there is no node where `.parentId` returns
`Nothing` (or an empty list is passed)

    [ ( "leaf1", Just "root" )
    , ( "leaf2", Just "root" )
    ]
    |> stratify { id = Tuple.first, parentId = Tuple.second, transform = Tuple.first }
    --> Err NoRoot

**`NodeItsOwnParent a`** happens when `.id` is the same as `.parentId` for a node:

    [ ("loop", Just "loop") ]
    |> stratify { id = Tuple.first, parentId = Tuple.second, transform = Tuple.first }
    --> Err (NodeItsOwnParent "loop")

**`DuplicatedId a`** happens when there are two (or more) elements that return the same
`.id`.

**`DisconnectedNodes (Tree a)`** happens when not all input items connect to the tree
(i.e. there are "orphan" items). This is an error where a tree was constructed, but
this error signals that some of the data is missing in the resulting tree.

{-| The other way tree data is sometimes represented in flat formats
is that each item stores a path to the root. Common examples are filesystems
where we see file paths such as "foo/bar/baz.txt" or DNS "my.domain.com".

This function will recreate the tree based on these paths:

    [ "Tree"
    , "Tree/Zipper"
    , "Tree/Diff/Internal"
    , "Tests"
    ]
    |> stratifyWithPath
        { path = String.split "/"

    -->               ]
    -->           ]
    -->       , singleton "Tests"
    -->       ]
    -->   )

Because `stratifyWithPath` creates missing nodes in the hierarchy,
it will succeed with most input data. The only way to make it fail
is if there are items with duplicate paths. In that case the `Err`
contains the path that was duplicated.

    [ [ "foo" ] , [ "foo" ] ]
        |> stratifyWithPath { path = identity, createMissingNode = identity }
    --> Err [ "foo" ]

The root of the tree is always represented by the empty list. However,
if the empty list has only one child, than the result will have that
node as the root. This can avoid a problem of creating a superflous wrapper
node.

have real values at the leaves of the tree, but synthetic values are
valuable to derive at other levels. For instance in a tree representing
a filesystem of a software project, only files have lines of code,

sense to assign to each directory the total lines contained in all
the files inside it.
