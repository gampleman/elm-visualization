{-| This module implements a velocity Verlet numerical integrator for simulating physical forces on particles.
The simulation is simplified: it assumes a constant unit time step *Δt = 1* for each step, and a constant unit
mass *m = 1* for all particles. As a result, a force *F* acting on a particle is equivalent to a constant
acceleration *a* over the time interval *Δt*, and can be simulated simply by adding to the particle’s velocity,
which is then added to the particle’s position.

In the domain of information visualization, physical simulations are useful for studying networks and hierarchies!

{-| Visualization.Force needs to compute and update positions and velocities on any objects that it is simulating.
However, you can use your own data structure to manage these, as long as the individual objects expose the necessary
properties. Therefore this type alias is an extensible record allowing you to avoid excessive nesting.

The `id` property must be unique among objects, otherwise some of the colliding objects will be ignored by the simulation.

Also take care when initializing the positions so that the points don't overlap.

{-| The centering force translates nodes uniformly so that the mean position of all nodes (the center of mass) is at
the given position ⟨x,y⟩. This force modifies the positions of nodes on each application; it does not modify velocities,
as doing so would typically cause the nodes to overshoot and oscillate around the desired center. This force helps keep
nodes in the center of the viewport, and it does not distort their relative positions.

{-| The many-body (or n-body) force applies mutually amongst all nodes. It can be used to simulate gravity (attraction)
if the strength is positive, or electrostatic charge (repulsion) if the strength is negative.

to it.

The default strength is -30 simulating a repulsing charge.

force is proportional to the difference between the linked nodes’ distance and the target distance, similar to a spring
force.

The link distance here is 30, the strength of the force is proportional to the number of links on each side of the
present link, according to the formule: `1 / min (count souce) (count target)` where `count` if a function that counts
links connected to those nodes.
